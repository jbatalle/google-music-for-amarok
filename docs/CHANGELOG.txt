v1.6:
- Added button to manually chat playing track in all Skype open chats. 
- Added option to chat playing track in all Skype open chats on every track change.
- Fixed some bugs on changing mood text on Skype.
- Created a workaround for Amarok bug that on track Change gives multiple notify. (I hope)

v1.5:
- Retrieves more descriptive informations on errors when sends post fails, especially on facebook that has the API quite selective, so you can get an idea of what's wrong!

v1.4:
- Many bugs correct on server side. (The correction of these errors is continuous and is not necessarily linked to release of new versions.)
- Force resizing to 100x100 for cover art when uploading on Flickr, 
  because Facebook uses 75x75 image as link and as result the operation is more fast and there are minor possibility of errors.
- Added skype as Social Networks (curl and python-dbus must be installed.)
- Changed the method for open the web pages.
- Fixed minor graphics bugs.

v1.3:
- Added Flickr option, for upload Cover Arts in a space that allows to create a link instead of as normal picture when you post on Facebook. Read the Help for the Configuration.
- Implemented Google+ in the code but disabled it because the API actually is read only.

v1.2:
- Added option for attach Cover Art (if exist) in the Post message.
- WARNING: for existing facebook users, the app must be deleted from App Center and then must be granted again (sorry).

v1.1:
- Fixed message options for Twitter and changed default text.
- Others minor bugs fixed.

v1.0:
- First script release.
