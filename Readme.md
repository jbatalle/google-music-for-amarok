Google Music for Amarok

This script allows you to listen your music allocated in your account in Google Music in your Amarok player.

== INSTRUCTIONS ==
Download this script and put it into scripts directory (usually ~/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts/). Then, active the script in your Amarok 
configuration.

== IMPORTANT ==
You need to have installed curl.

Once the plugin is installed, you can see a new option in Tools Menu. Here you have to put your google account. Then, you can download the 
list of songs pushing the button allocated in the Tools Menu ("Update Google Music List"). After a few seconds, Amarok shows an alert in 
order to confirm the correct downloaded. Then restart Amarok to check the list of songs downloaded.

At this moment is only a basic system, works fine but needs more little changes in order to improve the reliability.
