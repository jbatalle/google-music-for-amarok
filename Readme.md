Google Music for Amarok

This script allows you to listen your music allocated in your Google Music account using Amarok.

INSTRUCTIONS
Download this script and put it into scripts directory (usually ~/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts/). Then, active the script in your Amarok 
configuration.

Once the plugin is installed, you can see a new option in Tools Menu. Here you have to put your google account. Then, you can see a new 
collection with your songs.

At this moment is only a basic system, works fine but needs more little changes in order to improve the reliability.
